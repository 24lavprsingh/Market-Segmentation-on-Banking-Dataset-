# FINAL FINDINGS 
# Cluster 1:

Customers in Cluster 1 have relatively high 'BALANCE,' 'PURCHASES,' 'ONEOFF_PURCHASES,' and 'CREDIT_LIMIT.'
They also have a moderate 'PURCHASES_FREQUENCY' and 'PURCHASES_TRX' (number of purchase transactions).
The 'CASH_ADVANCE' is moderate, indicating some cash advance usage.
This cluster represents customers who use their credit cards frequently for purchases, including both one-off and installment purchases, and tend to maintain a higher credit balance.

# Cluster 2:

Customers in Cluster 2 have similar mean values for most attributes to those in Cluster 1, but with slightly lower 'BALANCE' and 'CREDIT_LIMIT.'
They also show similar purchase behaviors with moderate 'PURCHASES_FREQUENCY' and 'PURCHASES_TRX.'
The 'CASH_ADVANCE' usage is again moderate.
This cluster represents customers who exhibit similar purchase behaviors to those in Cluster 1 but with slightly lower credit limits and balances.

# Cluster 3:

Customers in Cluster 3 have slightly lower 'BALANCE' and 'CREDIT_LIMIT' compared to both Cluster 1 and 2.
Their 'PURCHASES' and 'ONEOFF_PURCHASES' are higher compared to Cluster 2 but lower than Cluster 'PURCHASES_FREQUENCY' and 'PURCHASES_TRX' are moderate.
The 'CASH_ADVANCE' usage is similar to the other clusters.
This cluster represents customers with a more balanced purchase behavior, making moderate purchases and using their credit cards and cash advances more prudently.
